# Luminous Deep Growth Engine Strategy

## 1. The Core Pattern: Turn IP into Products
**Concept**: Repackage agency know-how + immersive tech into software & content.

*   **The Engine**: Immersive "living house" UX + object-based storytelling.
*   **The Method**: Writers' Room (Planner/Visual/Canon), Conductor specs, Content Packs, Governance.
*   **The Testbed**: Isle of Wight as a "safe training ground" + fibre + community context.

**Action**: Treat each room as a "chapter" that encodes IP:
*   **How to think** (Julian)
*   **How to feel + frame** (Eleanor)
*   **How to build + iterate** (Cassie)

## 2. Product Ecosystem Map
*   **A) Gift (Free/Trust)**: "3 minutes inside the house". Shareable quote-cards. "What you just experienced" breakdown.
*   **B) Prospect Product (Leads)**: Tiny assessment ("Where could AI remove 10 hours..."). Output: Personalised Next 3 Moves.
*   **C) Core Product (Paid)**: Pay-per-view rooms ("Unlock The Boathouse Logbook") or Season Pass.
*   **D) Client Services (High-Ticket)**: "We build your own 'House'" (Engine as a Service).

## 3. Waiting List & Oversight
*   **Campaign**: "Luminous Deep Season One: The Winter Signal".
*   **Mechanism**: Limited early passes (Founding Islanders).
*   **Goal**: Measurable intent for sponsors/investors.

## 4. Climb the Pyramid
*   **Tier 1 (Local)**: Island podcasts, business groups.
*   **Tier 2 (Regional)**: Solent innovation.
*   **Tier 3 (National Niche)**: Gov-tech, AI builders.
*   **Tier 4 (Global)**: Big platforms (later).

## 5. Content Filter (Prompt Generator)
Every post must hit one:
*   **Scary**: "The work you do manually is being automated."
*   **Sexy**: "World-class marketing without an agency."
*   **Strange**: "A website that behaves like a living house."
*   **Familiar**: "Island stories, ferries, local pride."
*   **Free**: "Template / Checklist."

## 6. The "11 Touches" Ladder
*   **Short**: 30-60s quote/object.
*   **Medium**: 3-6 min guided room walk-through.
*   **Long**: 20-40 min NotebookLM podcast ("Behind the House").
*   **Deep**: Interactive content inside the house.

## 7. Immediate Execution
*   **Define Season One**: 6-9 rooms (Chapters).
*   **Perfect Room Loop**: Assets -> Hotspots -> Copy -> Audio -> Outbound.
*   **Content Conveyor**: House Content -> LinkedIn/Email -> NotebookLM/White Paper.
